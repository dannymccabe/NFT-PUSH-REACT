# NFT Marketplace - P U S H
I built this website as a portfolio showpiece. I used a variety of new tools and different techniques whereever I could. This project has taken me quite a substantial amount of time so I hope you enjoy it.

I modelled the colour palette off tailwindcss.com because I love the colours.
